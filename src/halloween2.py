Micropython halloween show, LjÃ³svallagata 30, 2023

Available:
* Spider on a string on a motor
* ws2812 lights.
* PIR sensor
* "radar" sensor
* Perhaps: speakers...

Intent is:
## While idle:
 * led strips around door play a cool/dark slow purply/green idle ripples

## When people detected coming towards doorway
 * spider descends rapidly down
 * led strips switch to "agitated" with reds and oranges
 * Spider slowly re-ascends
 * led strips decay back to idle pattern

## Expected manual requirements
 * even if we get encoders in place, in time, we'll need a way to re-adjust the "position" of the spider
   so we don't get it all over the place
 * manual "start show" button
 * manual override of the "idle" pattern
 * OTA?  We _might_ be ok with just webrepl and mpremote? (probably not, it's a "TODO" after mp1.20...)


## Stretch goals
 * statsd/whatever to track events, because, why not go overboard
 ** https://github.com/ssube/prometheus_express (and just straight grafana....)
 ** https://github.com/ssube/prometheus_express/pull/32 (for asyncio version)
 * or
 ** port https://github.com/jsocol/pystatsd/ to micropython (looks easy to port)
 ** https://github.com/WoLpH/python-statsd (not touched sine 2017 though..
 ** and needs graphite as well then...

 I _do_ feel that statsd style push is _probably_ less intrusive for this style of project
 as it doesn't need a full webserver interrupting things at arbitrary times, but... lets try shall we...

Initial mock of what the halloween show should do...

## Failures
We're disobeying our first rules about having control and OTA available first,
and using that to get the rest of it deployed.
Partly, this is because we don't even know what the control layer should really look like!


# Ok, so... what next....
* an actual motor control with position based on the encoder, so that it can drive the "right" amount to keep it in place?
 => we might end up having the spider on the ground, and leaps up?  so it can lower down instead?
* we really will need remote access to it...
* we can probably hardcode wifi AP though right?
 => Put it on a powerbank, hardcode tweak credentials, make sure it's reachable?
 => much less work than a wifi manager, which we'd need to "productize" it...
* ok, still need... websockets repl, or mqtt, or ... what?
* I quite like mqtt, I'm used to it...
